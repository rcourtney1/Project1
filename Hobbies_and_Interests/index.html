<h1><strong>Interest and Hobbies</strong></h1>
<h2>Riding Harley-Davidson Motorcycles</h2>
<p>I ride every chance I get. It helps me to clear my mind and it lets you feel in control. I know that there are inherit dangers but to really feel free it is worth the risk. I current own a 2010 1200 Sportster Low and I am in the process of purchasing a 2011 Ultra Classic.</p>

<p>I am a memeber of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association (CVMA), we are a group of veterans that ride motorcycles as a hobby and help other veterans through charitable causes. Our motto is "Vets Helping Vets"</p>

<h2>Studying History</h2>
<p>I have several passions in my life and history rates near the top. I love all history and believe in the old saying, "Those that fail to study history are doomed to repeat it." I love studying World War Two and the United States Constitution the most.</p>
